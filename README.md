# Stockmarket_Info_Finder
My second python project - stockmarket information an charting. Initially the goal was to get end of day prices for stocks and write a file saving this so that I could
create charts. Then I discovered the yfinance module and had fun making a simple program utilising the information it can find. 
I would be grateful for any feedback on my coding style to help me improve the functionality and readability where possible.
If there is a feature you would like to see added into the program then please let me know and I will work on it.
